# The View From Flyover Country  

#### By Sarah Kendzior

The promise of this book was to give a view of what the midwest has experienced in its decline over the past few decades, explaining the why of its politics through the lens of the economic impacts they have felt. 

The book fell short of that in that it seemed largely concerned with the issues of academia and journalism, to areas that the author was intimately involved in as an anthropologist student and a journalist. 

There were some exceptions. 

Notable bits:

* Artists living in expensive cities need patrons or to be wealthy, cutting out many. Inexpensive places suffer from prejudice against the artists. Expensive places put artists in a gilded cage. 
* A bit about gentrification and it pushing out the residents. In particular, the idea of economic conservative, social liberal is just that of being conservative. The idea that depressed neighborhoods need new people instead of new resources, is at the heart of gentrification and is a lie. 
* Loss of malls to online retailers. Instead of zombie consumers, one has zombie workers. 
* Failure of jobs, even for PhDs. "Get a job instead" to those who pursue the higher degrees, "get better education" to those who pursue a job. 
* Major point: To work with NGOs, UN, humanitarian stuff, one needs internships in expensive cities, cutting out vast swaths of people from that option. The only option to "do good" for many is to work in the military, though they get discarded when done instead of working up a ladder. People want to do meaningful stuff with their lives and they are thwarted by lack of money. This is a major source of hatred to the pious liberal elites who have cutoff the access to those of lower economic means. 
* Journalists used to be able to work their way up, not needing education. But now they need advanced degrees and are lucky to get paid at all for their words, "given exposure" instead.  (Story of Atlantic not wanting to pay a reporter for their work and that being made public by the reporter). 
* Story of Adjuncts. Making very little, no benefits, having to go to conferences to get jobs, being looked down upon by the tenured. 
* People working two jobs living in homeless shelters. Employers are not paying people money because they can. 
* "In America, there is little chance at a reversal of fortune for those less fortunate. Poverty is a sentence for the crime of existing. Poverty is a denial of rights sold as a character flaw." (p.50)
* "Era of unpaid internships and full-time jobs turn into contingency labor" (p.55)
* War on Poverty --> War on the Poor
* People setting themselves on fire (p. 57). October 4, 2013 man on national mall did so. Men have done so around the world. Their stated reason is an inability to have the economic resources to support their family. "Self-immolation has long been an act of protest against corrupt and tyrannical rule...the difference between these acts of protest and the unemployed men on fire is that today we are not sure who is in charge. 
* Dismissing notion of charity. Big donations for one dying boy while many children starve needlessly. Full-time workers whose employers encourage charity to help them instead of raising their wages. 
* We don't plan long-term because if we do, we'll just get our hearts broken" (Linda Tirado, blogger, p.66) "It is best not to hope. You just take what you can get as you spot it."  
* "Charity, for the giver, is the trade of cash for a moral fix...But it is an investment in the present, not the future. If you value the future--if you value a societry where people can imagine their future--work for justice." p.67
* "Greatest barrier to entry in many professions is financial, not intellectual." p.73
* Millenial parents feeling their children will not have opportunities. Scholarships reserved for the rich. High tuition leads to the poor being locked out and the middle joining their ranks through debt. Going from a merit economy to a privilege economy: connections and money needed to get jobs. (feudalism writ large)
* Mothers opting out of work or child-raising due to economic forces, not because of an actual choice about whether to raise their child or go to work. Expense of child care can be more than the cost of working. 
* Bits on racism, and debate over free speech
* Academic paywalls, adjuncts, faculty considered dispensable.
* Some academic work would be useful to people struggling against governments elsewhere, but the paywalls prevent the access to them. 
* Blind eye to financial is BS because of the hundreds of thousands paid on children by wealthy for elite experiences. Essentially "merit" comes from "wealth" and it becomes a wealth based system which also denigrates those who are poor.  "For upper-class parents, the college admissions process has become a test of loyalty: What will you spend, what values will you compromise, for your child to be accepted?" p.146
* College degrees eliminated old rich bloodlines, creating new class of elites. But those elites were then threatened by the next generation if anyone could get a degree. So make it costly and prevent others from joining the ranks. Tuition more than doubled since 2000: purchasing credentials, jobs that don't need them do require them, lessening the diversity of voices. Particularly hard hitting in the ones dispensing information: journalism, academia. All from elite background.  "College does not offer a better future, but a less worse one. College is not a cure for economic insecurity, but a symptom of the broader plague of credentialism." 
* Olga Khazan of Atlantic offered to publish Nate Thayer's article about North Korea but could not pay him for it. p. 157.  The Atlantic had a record profit despite claiming they could not pay contributors for their work. (2012)  Majority of country want inequality to end, but feel that we can't. 
* Journalists are those who can afford to pay to be journalists. 
* Mainstream media incident (january 8, 2014) where Emma Keller wrote a disparaging piece about a woman dying of cancer that was tweeting. Then more examples of mainstream media making people's lives miserable, suicides, etc.  "The terms of public debate are rarely set by the public." p.180  Elites debate matters like whether race matters while those for which it does matter are locked out by the need for wealth to become credentialed (both college and internships) as well as networks. 
* Complains about the argument angle for including more women (in foreign affairs) because of their perspective whether than simply that it would be more fair to have an equal playing field. 
* "Ten years after the Irag war, we continue to live in an era of hysteerical panic about invented catastrophes and false reassurances about real catastrophes." p.201
* Story of Uzbek where following the law is radical. The idea of written laws requiring government and people to actually follow them. 
* Story of water being turned off in Detroit while Congress shut down the government over debt stuff.
