# Debt

#### by David Graeber

Thick, wonderful book. Deserves a thorough read. 

Essentially makes a long and compelling argument that debt is at the foundation of our social relations, that it precedes money and is, in fact, money, and makes the compelling point, even on page 3, that why should bad debts have to be repaid? This is really where he drives at, but he gives a fascinating history along the way. But I think this is one of the most essential points: if a bad debt is made, then the one loaning the money loses. 

Sadly, I don't have time to go through it now. Hopefully will get to return to it. 

One  point that stuck with me is that people have a lot of emotional trauma and shame associated with debt, leading to revolutions, etc, that caste and slavery systems seemed not to have as much of. 

Women seem have to been very bad off for a lot of it. 

Interesting description of feudalism, Venice, India, China, .... Should just read this again.
