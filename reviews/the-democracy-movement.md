# The Democracy Movement

#### by David Graeber

Mainly a description of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the history, reactions, the anarchist foundations of how it was run. 

The point here is that it gives a glimpse of an alternative to our current government/capitalist setup, highlighting the importance of individuals, but, in my opinion, also highlighting the unlikely character of it being possible at scale. 

This will be quite random access bits: 

* Media. A lot of protests do not get covered by media. OWS was for a bit perhaps because of the hope of a Tea Party like movement on the left, but OWS was not interested in participating in governance, simply with occupying. 
* Tapped into a lot of frustration about debt. This is a key part of what gets to people. Also the diminished prospects for the young, the convesion of university into simply a way to get jobs, punishing those who wanted to contribute to the knowledge of the world. 
* Prior, companies profiting, such as GM, led to general prosperity. Starting somewhere in the 70s to 80s and accelerating ever since, this has been less true, with profit flowing to the top. This presumably has a lot to do with reduced taxes on the upper incomes, allowing the top people to keep more thereby incentivizing them to have the flows of money go towards themselves. 
* "deregulation" in 80s was really financialization of companies which really was "printing money". p.78  (Car loans from car companies, for example, are where profits are made)
* Government bailing out these companies with the politicians getting paid by the companies to regulate them. Profits going to the top, the bottom getting squeezed by fees, etc. 
* Student loans not being renegotiable, stiff penalties, etc.  
* Capitalist feudalism, the demands of being free from debt and minimum to live on, is a sign of peasantry. Their conclusion was a need for a new system. "They are broadening our conception of meaningful work to include everything we do that isn't for ourselves." (p. 87)
* Desire not to engage in the poitical system. Blames on Obama, promising change, looking very much like a new direction, but then keeping in place all the institutions just as they are. So younger generation was greatly disappointed and disgusted by it. The young did what they were supposed to: go to college, vote for progressive candidate, but they got screwed over so screw the system. 
* "How did there come to be such an enormous gap between the way so many Americans actually viewed the world--including a population of young people, most of whom where prepared to contemplate jettisoning the capitalist system entirely--and the opinions that could be expressed in public forums?" p.101
* In the 120s and so, deep discussion about relationship of finance (banks), military, international system based on treasury bonds (tribute), the role of propaganda terms as evidence for militaristic control, the idea of material wealth flowing into the seat of the empire (America) and the financialization (rent extraction) in that seat of the empire, the creation of money (seignorage) from war debt (money not fixed finite quantity), and then the anger of those siding with the right at being deprived of the opportunity to contribute anything beyond material survival (elites keeping human rights lawyers jobs to themselves) Also the use of the term human rights instead of more explicit terms such as rape, torture, and murder. 
* Describes the police tactics of eviction of OWS with an emphasis on filth. 
* Talks about General Assembly, which is everyone gets to speak (see also People's Mic / Mic Check of those repeating what speaker said to spread to others) and based on consensus to a spokescouncil model which strikes me suspciciously similar to representative democracy with the biggest difference being the temporary nature of being a spoke, but that could easily change over time. 

* election vs lottery described. the idea of anyone who wants to hold office having their name randomly drawn from the pool of people. 
* long discussion of the founding of the american form of democracy, aristocratic democracy. 
* rational as being distanced, rulers basically
* talks about rural Madagascar where government ceased to function, but everyone pretended it did. crime went down. But in another document, he talks about how they dealt with a violent person by trying to kill the person. This I think is rather important. 

* consensus discussion. basically, it is an attitude of caring about heairng other people's views and finding a most compatible method. Voting can be disenfranchising and enraging, leading to it being most applicable in military situations in which everyone is armed and the majority will inflict more damage on the minority. 
* pretty important problem/point is that of those who can walk away and the community walking away (expelling). This works well for groups that are just forming for a common purpose (be clear on the purpose!), but less clear how it can expand to a world of 7 billion people (to me). 

* idea that there are global revolutions every 50 years or so that generally don't change actual power, but do change notions from something that was fringe to something accepted as common wisdom.  
* Political structure of our time seems designed to convince everyone of need of capitalism, but is not actually economically productive --one fourth of Americans are on "guard duty" (p.281): "defending property, supervising work, or otherwise keeping their fellow Americans in line" from Guard Labor Journal of Development Economics (2006) pp.328-348, Arjun Jayadev and Samuel Bowles. Notes that US, UK, Greece, and Spain have roughly 20-24 perent of workers doing such work while Scandinavian countries a mere 1 in 10. Key factor seems to be inequality: more wealth in 1%, more guard labor. 
* "Yet as a result of putting virtually all of their efforts in the political basket, we are left in the bizarre situation of watching the capitalist system crumbling before our eyes, at just the moment everyone had finally concluded no other system would be possible." p.282
* "The problem is the stifling system of debt and violence, created to ensure that those powers of imagination are not used--" p. 295


On the whole, a lot I like in here, but he exaggerates the point, I think. Reduction of police, prisons, laws to the core of stopping actual violence is reasonable to me, but eliminating them all entirely seems to be absurd. He often seems to put up a straw person of war against all as what to rail against. But it is really dealing with the small numbers of people who are violent. Let's say 1 in 1000 people have intrinsically violent tendencies. In the Baltimore area with 2 million people, this would be 2000 violent people. How is that to be dealt with? By community deciding to kill people they think are violent? Is this by consensus? Suspicion of strangers would rise, groups would form and then uneasy peaces would happen. If economics broke down (meaning trading of goods), then violence would ensue. Having a (much smaller) group of professionals to help keep violence in order is important. The basic problem is keeping them from being economic enforcers of the wealthy.
