# Bullshit Jobs

A discourse on the phenomen of bullshit job: "a bullshit job is a form ofpaid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employmnent, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case."

Surveys indicate 40% of people are in self-identified BS jobs. 

It is a very good book with a 5 out of 5 recommendation from me. Read it! It explains everything.

## Rough outline

The book first details what is meant by a bullshit job, namely one that is useless. 

### Categorizing BS Jobs

1. Flunkies. They are largely around to make others feel more important by having others around. Often busy little tasks that don't seem to have much to do with a job description or being useful. Sometimes they sit somewhere just as a warm body.
2. Goons. Largely those without social value. An example might be someone who edits advertisements to make women look unrealistically thin in a way that makes real women feel bad about themselves. These are non-good PR types, corporate lawyers, telemarketers...
3. Duct Tapers. These are people doing something that only exists because the problem is not fixed, for some reason. Example is of a form submission setup that must be routed to a person because they decided to change the format but did not change a program. Or being a "proofreader" of someone whose reports are beyond awful. 
4. Box Tickers. They serve to simply ensure that some rule is being observed. Example: someone filling out a preference form that someone has to put in somewhere but the results are never consulted. Others might be highlighting pointless forms, helping people jump through government hoops, asking for funds, or be bureaucrats almost anywhere. 
5. Taskmasters. People who assign tasks to others even though those others could easily figure out what they need to do (Type 1) or people who create and oversee bullshit jobs (Type 2): "strategic" and other buzzwordy bullshit. 

### Why are people miserable in BS Jobs

This is a crucial question. Humans want to do something useful. They have their own intrinsic measurements as well as external. They want the validation that if they were to disappear, then someone would miss them. 

A great story is about someone who was the first to go to college from their family, very proud, got hired afterwards to deal with a content management system that was broken and that no one there wanted to work, and then tried to quit repeatedly. First the person learned a language. Then went on long drunk lunches, then long drunk weekends. Eventually, found someone else to take their job and quit while the boss was away on vacation. 

Humans generally have an MO of completing their work and then going off to do something else. A BS job does not allow that since there is no work to complete. It is not useful, but it is also never ending. One must also look busy, living a lie. 

Some of this are useful jobs that are basically being on call. There is not much to do every day, but there might be times when one is needed. In between, the vacuum of having nothing to do is dreadful. 

Doing anything useful, even if it is not for one's own benefit is far preferable for most people than to do something utterly and clearly pointless:  digging out rocks to build a draining trench is tough, but fine; digging a hole up just to put it all back and then repeat and repeat is completely dreadful. 

## What it is like to have a bs job

Looking busy is a necessity in many places. This leads to social media consumption, browsing the web when one can. One clever person used a terminal and text browser to browser the internet, giving the appearance of a lot of technical stuff. 

How do you talk about what you do in this situation. Terrible. 

Boredom, stress, embarassment, feeling worthless. Supervisors that can be very controlling. Makes analogy with S&M play but without the stop word. 

Not even being able to feel misery because the physical conditions are not bad. Consoling each other without being able to talk about the truth of the situation. 

Rights-scolding -- why do you feel you have a right to such-and-such.  Having a crappy job is their lot in life...

Big problem is that one cannot have the time and energy to do something useful outside of the work hours. It is not clear that this will be the case causing people to feel even worse, but it is the way it goes. 

NGOs and box tickers. Trying to help people, but the box ticking must be boxed for them to get help. Example of people needing SSI help and being forced to go to therapy and yet not actually needing the help. More paperwork, better chances of help. A therapist having to run an anger management course for those who were having rage against not having enough food and police maltreatment.

"being forced to commit acts of arbitrary bureaucratic cruelty against one's will. To become the face of the machine that one despises." (p. 134)

Creativity is an act of defiance, but it often is of something of an entirely different notion from the trained in career that one is doing. An engineer that got caught in a BS situation doing some poetry. 

## Why Are Bullshit Jobs Proliferating?

Bullshit jobs are increasing. Argument based on looking at "service" jobs that are increasing. One survey separated out "information" from "services" and the information sector is what is growing. That has a lot of BS in it. 

Theory: technology has enabled necessary jobs to be greatly reduced. This would be a crisis for the population as jobs are the primary methodology for surviving. Thus, pointless jobs should be promoted and encouraged. 

Example: Obama said he dropped the single-payer approach because he wanted to preserve the millions of jobs. Note that this is an admission that these are pointless jobs. 

False arguments about BS jobs:  the jobs are not BS, but appear pointless because the workers can't see the interconnected parts of the whole complex global supply chain. The other is that BS jobs are a product of government interference. Counterexample: rise of administrative positions in private universities (+240% in staff, +85% in administrators, vs +50% for faculty and student enrollments). Administrators at private colleges have gone up +135% while public has gone up +66% over years from 1975 to 2005. The public is government. So something other than government is presumably driving this and there is no major complexification over that time. 

Mentions bureaucracies setup to pay out large sums froma settlement to millions of claimants. Lots of stuff done to draw out the process to keep the money flowing to those administrating. 

Bankers do a lot of money shuffling, taking small cuts of transactions, but thereby doing lots of transactions. Bank workers not having any idea how their work fit into the business. Managers missing in action.  

Story of someone who analyzed a bank fo 60k employees for security risks. Determined about 80% of them were not needed. Fellow found ways to automate much, but was resoundly rejected as it would eliminate employees and thus the manager above them. 

Big term: Managerial Feudalism. Basic idea is having a plethora of people that make the manager seem useful and important, valued, possibly giving control gratification, but at least valued. They squeeze the productive employees, mercilessly, but the BSers they keep as they have real control over them (being useless, they have no power). 

Classical Feudalism did leave autonomy to the workers. Not true in managerial feudalism. 

Example of a factory where the workers routinely improved efficiency. Then managers started growing in abundance, no improvements to efficiency, but more costs so decided to shut factory down and move it to cheaper place. Used to be productivity gains went to workers, but then that stopped in the 1970s. This is also when wealth inequality started to spike and is also when income taxes on the top rate went down from 90% to 70% and then in the 80s/90s it was down to 30 to 40%. Clear as day from the graphs. 

Rise of managerial types in artist endeavors, middle people that are in the business of selling and organizing the art, but not actually supporting the development of art.

There is a lot of excess profit and this leads to rent extraction and the rise of many levels of lords. This is not capitalism, but feudalism arising. 

## Why Do We as a Society Not Object to the Growth of Pointless Employment?

Mostly, valuing jobs even if they are worthless rather than free time that produces no monetary value even if it produces good social value. 

Hard workers working at nothing that creates any benefit to society. 

Lots of people could vanish and never be missed. Top positions unfilled for years without anyone noticing. 

Six month bank strike in Ireland in 1970 -- no one noticed or cared. In 1968, New York City garbage strike was resolved in ten days because the city became uninhabitable. 

Gives a list of relative value generated by different workers to society. Financial was deemed quite negative, researchers deemed quite high. 

A lot of useful people are paid poorly, a lot of useless people are paid very well. Exceptions happen on both, but mostly the more one makes, the less useful one actually is. 

This makes sense to some people as being useful to society is its own reward while being useless is painful and should be well compensated for that. Head scratching. 

Notion of entering adulthood by earning money in the high middle ages. Work was transformative. Valued.

Industrial capitalism exponentiated that value of work and drove it home.
