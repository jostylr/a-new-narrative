# Bullshit Jobs

A discourse on the phenomen of bullshit job: "a bullshit job is a form ofpaid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employmnent, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case."

Surveys indicate 40% of people are in self-identified BS jobs. 

It is a very good book with a 5 out of 5 recommendation from me. Read it! It explains everything. 

## by David Graeber

Anarchist anthropologist at London School of Economics. 

## Rough outline

The book first details what is meant by a bullshit job, namely one that is useless. 

### Categorizing BS Jobs

1. Flunkies. They are largely around to make others feel more important by having others around. Often busy little tasks that don't seem to have much to do with a job description or being useful. Sometimes they sit somewhere just as a warm body.
2. Goons. Largely those without social value. An example might be someone who edits advertisements to make women look unrealistically thin in a way that makes real women feel bad about themselves. These are non-good PR types, corporate lawyers, telemarketers...
3. Duct Tapers. These are people doing something that only exists because the problem is not fixed, for some reason. Example is of a form submission setup that must be routed to a person because they decided to change the format but did not change a program. Or being a "proofreader" of someone whose reports are beyond awful. 
4. Box Tickers. They serve to simply ensure that some rule is being observed. Example: someone filling out a preference form that someone has to put in somewhere but the results are never consulted. Others might be highlighting pointless forms, helping people jump through government hoops, asking for funds, or be bureaucrats almost anywhere. 
5. Taskmasters. People who assign tasks to others even though those others could easily figure out what they need to do (Type 1) or people who create and oversee bullshit jobs (Type 2): "strategic" and other buzzwordy bullshit. 

### Why are people miserable in BS Jobs

This is a crucial question. Humans want to do something useful. They have their own intrinsic measurements as well as external. They want the validation that if they were to disappear, then someone would miss them. 

A great story is about someone who was the first to go to college from their family, very proud, got hired afterwards to deal with a content management system that was broken and that no one there wanted to work, and then tried to quit repeatedly. First the person learned a language. Then went on long drunk lunches, then long drunk weekends. Eventually, found someone else to take their job and quit while the boss was away on vacation. 

Humans generally have an MO of completing their work and then going off to do something else. A BS job does not allow that since there is no work to complete. It is not useful, but it is also never ending. One must also look busy, living a lie. 

Some of this are useful jobs that are basically being on call. There is not much to do every day, but there might be times when one is needed. In between, the vacuum of having nothing to do is dreadful. 

Doing anything useful, even if it is not for one's own benefit is far preferable for most people than to do something utterly and clearly pointless:  digging out rocks to build a draining trench is tough, but fine; digging a hole up just to put it all back and then repeat and repeat is completely dreadful. 

## What it is like to have a bs job

Looking busy is a necessity in many places. This leads to social media consumption, browsing the web when one can. One clever person used a terminal and text browser to browser the internet, giving the appearance of a lot of technical stuff. 

How do you talk about what you do in this situation. Terrible. 

Boredom, stress, embarassment, feeling worthless. Supervisors that can be very controlling. Makes analogy with S&M play but without the stop word. 

Not even being able to feel misery because the physical conditions are not bad. Consoling each other without being able to talk about the truth of the situation. 

Rights-scolding -- why do you feel you have a right to such-and-such.  Having a crappy job is their lot in life...

Big problem is that one cannot have the time and energy to do something useful outside of the work hours. It is not clear that this will be the case causing people to feel even worse, but it is the way it goes. 

NGOs and box tickers. Trying to help people, but the box ticking must be boxed for them to get help. Example of people needing SSI help and being forced to go to therapy and yet not actually needing the help. More paperwork, better chances of help. A therapist having to run an anger management course for those who were having rage against not having enough food and police maltreatment.

"being forced to commit acts of arbitrary bureaucratic cruelty against one's will. To become the face of the machine that one despises." (p. 134)

Creativity is an act of defiance, but it often is of something of an entirely different notion from the trained in career that one is doing. An engineer that got caught in a BS situation doing some poetry. 

## Why Are Bullshit Jobs Proliferating?

Bullshit jobs are increasing. Argument based on looking at "service" jobs that are increasing. One survey separated out "information" from "services" and the information sector is what is growing. That has a lot of BS in it. 

Theory: technology has enabled necessary jobs to be greatly reduced. This would be a crisis for the population as jobs are the primary methodology for surviving. Thus, pointless jobs should be promoted and encouraged. 

Example: Obama said he dropped the single-payer approach because he wanted to preserve the millions of jobs. Note that this is an admission that these are pointless jobs. 

False arguments about BS jobs:  the jobs are not BS, but appear pointless because the workers can't see the interconnected parts of the whole complex global supply chain. The other is that BS jobs are a product of government interference. Counterexample: rise of administrative positions in private universities (+240% in staff, +85% in administrators, vs +50% for faculty and student enrollments). Administrators at private colleges have gone up +135% while public has gone up +66% over years from 1975 to 2005. The public is government. So something other than government is presumably driving this and there is no major complexification over that time. 

Mentions bureaucracies setup to pay out large sums froma settlement to millions of claimants. Lots of stuff done to draw out the process to keep the money flowing to those administrating. 

Bankers do a lot of money shuffling, taking small cuts of transactions, but thereby doing lots of transactions. Bank workers not having any idea how their work fit into the business. Managers missing in action.  

Story of someone who analyzed a bank fo 60k employees for security risks. Determined about 80% of them were not needed. Fellow found ways to automate much, but was resoundly rejected as it would eliminate employees and thus the manager above them. 

Big term: Managerial Feudalism. Basic idea is having a plethora of people that make the manager seem useful and important, valued, possibly giving control gratification, but at least valued. They squeeze the productive employees, mercilessly, but the BSers they keep as they have real control over them (being useless, they have no power). 

Classical Feudalism did leave autonomy to the workers. Not true in managerial feudalism. 

Example of a factory where the workers routinely improved efficiency. Then managers started growing in abundance, no improvements to efficiency, but more costs so decided to shut factory down and move it to cheaper place. Used to be productivity gains went to workers, but then that stopped in the 1970s. This is also when wealth inequality started to spike and is also when income taxes on the top rate went down from 90% to 70% and then in the 80s/90s it was down to 30 to 40%. Clear as day from the graphs. 

Rise of managerial types in artist endeavors, middle people that are in the business of selling and organizing the art, but not actually supporting the development of art.

There is a lot of excess profit and this leads to rent extraction and the rise of many levels of lords. This is not capitalism, but feudalism arising. 

## Why Do We as a Society Not Object to the Growth of Pointless Employment?

Mostly, valuing jobs even if they are worthless rather than free time that produces no monetary value even if it produces good social value. 

Hard workers working at nothing that creates any benefit to society. 

Lots of people could vanish and never be missed. Top positions unfilled for years without anyone noticing. 

Six month bank strike in Ireland in 1970 -- no one noticed or cared. In 1968, New York City garbage strike was resolved in ten days because the city became uninhabitable. (Note that this gives lots of power to those in charge. Useful workers have a measure of power, useless workers are entirely at the mercy of the whims of the people, just as was true in classical feudalism; killing all the farmers would be bad, but killing a bunch of those in the hierarchy would not make much of a difference). 

Gives a list of relative value generated by different workers to society. Financial was deemed quite negative, researchers deemed quite high. 

A lot of useful people are paid poorly, a lot of useless people are paid very well. Exceptions happen on both, but mostly the more one makes, the less useful one actually is. 

This makes sense to some people as being useful to society is its own reward while being useless is painful and should be well compensated for that. Head scratching. 

Notion of entering adulthood by earning money in the high middle ages. Work was transformative. Valued.

Industrial capitalism exponentiated that value of work and drove it home. 

[Abraham Lincoln 1861 First Annual Message](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29502):

>Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class--neither work for others nor have others working for them. In most of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families--wives, sons, and daughters--work for themselves on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital; that is, they labor with their own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class.

>Again, as has already been said, there is not of necessity any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life. Many independent men everywhere in these States a few years back in their lives were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of condition to all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty; none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess, and which if surrendered will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost.

Labor theory of value commmon sense in 1860; preposterous by 1920. "Producerism" (gospel of work as spiritual value) was commonplace. Robber Barons emerged post civil-war and changed this narrative. They transformed it into "consumerism". Basically, they said to trust the few wise capitalists in producing great stuff and the masses would live better than kings of previous generations (this actually did seem to happen!) The rise of the managerial class also happened in this period (say 1890s). This meant that the independent artisans who thought of themselves as part of a proud tradition suddenly were under the control and command of "scientific experts", treated as mere extensions of machines. 

He argues that the change was greatly affected by the patriarchial prejudice of producing stuff that was largely the domain of the male. He also slips in that early factory work was dominated by women and children until the men rebelled. Female work, "caring labor", is often overlooked. Cooks, gradening, raising children, teachers, maids, nurses, ..., these can all be part of the working class, but it is not what one generally thinks of. It is factory workers that do so. They were never the dominant force in the labor market. 

Relates story of the subway strike in London in which the tube workers had to point out that their biggest role were being caretakers of the passengers who needed help for one reason or another. He points out that many of the Marxist style revolutionaries overlooked that role, slipping into a discourse solely on the economics of production. 

We collectively made this world and continue to collectively make it! "It's even more true of abstractions like 'capitalism', 'society', or the 'government'. They only exist because we produce them every day." (p. 238)

We care for others, such as our family and friends. In preparing to maximally care for them, we preserve the many structures around us to the best of our ability. 

> (rearranged,p. 241) The paradox of modern work:
1. Most people's sense of dignity and self worth is caught up in working for a living.
2. Most people hate their jobs. 
3. (added) Work should be painful. Thus (1) happens because of (2). 

This is the crux of the promise and the hope of crafting a new narrative to break this notion. 

> Bullshit jobs proliferate today in large part because of the peculiar nature of managerial feudalism that has come to dominate wealthy economies--but to an increasing degree, all economies. They cause misery because human happiness is always caught up in a sense of having effects on the world; a feeling which most people, when they speak of their work, express through a language of social value. Yet at the same time they are aware that the greater the social value produced by a job, the less one is likely to be paid to do it. Like Annie, they are faced with the choice betweeen doing useful and important work like taking care of children but being effectively told that the gratification of helping others should be its own reward, and it's up to them to figure out how to pay their bills, or accepting pointless and degrading work that destroys their mind and body for no particular reason, other than a widespread feeling that if one does not engage in labor that destroys the mind and body, whether or not there is a reason to be doing it, one does not deserve to live. 

>The belief that what ultimately motivates human beings has always been, and must always be, the pursuit of wealth, power, comforts, and pleasure, has always and must always be complemented by a doctrine of work as self-sacrifice, as valuable *precisely* because it is the place of misery, sadism, emptiness, and despair.

One thought I had is that 

## What Are the Political Effects of Bullshit Jobs, and Is There Anything That Can Be Done About This Situation? 

Lots of resentment in this kind of system. Unemployed resent the employed (privileged), the employed resent the unemployed (freeloaders). Bullshit job holders resent those who get to do useful work, productive workers resent the better paid useless workers. 

Coastal elites vs midwest. Lots of "meaningful" positions, such as working for NGOs and UN, are only open to those who can afford to live in, say, NYC, with no salary as they intern and make connections: trading wealth for connections and experience. Those from working class roots cannot afford to do this. So the military becomes the avenue to contribute to something meaningful. 

Hollywood is a closed knit community and yet talk about egalitarian politics, ringing hollow. 

Making money is possible, doing something else, such as truth, beauty, justice, charity, etc., and get paid a living wage, then forget about it. The liberal elite has locked people out of it all. 

> The US military is a haven for frustrated altruists. 

Hence why anti-military spending is frustrating for so many. 

Gives a view that one is supposed to accumulate money and then one can be altruistic. Bitter path to the promise land. 

Talks about the rise of robots, makes analogy with sixties and how the free time there led to some crazy shit that made people want to make sure people had some bullshit to occupy and kill their soul. That was a little paraphrashed there. 

Talks about how technology could enable us to be free, but that just seems to put more and more managerial levels in place. 

> Automation *did*, in fact, lead to mass unemployment. We have simply stopped the gap by adding dummy jobs that are effectively made up. 

But people don't need jobs. We didn't have jobs for millenia. We'd be fine. We turn to community, gossiping, raising kids, watching out for each other, and inventing all sorts of crazy shit. 

Medical debt is primary cause of bankruptcies, student debt is what draws young people into the well paying bullshit jobs. 

Argues about Democratic Party being deeply in bed with the finance and the machinery of the bullshitization of everything. 

Finishes with arguing for Universal Basic Income. Gives an example of someone working in an NGO that helps people fill out the forms to get government aid and also fills out forms for the charities that support her NGO. A UBI would get rid of all of that since everyone would just get that money. It is about detaching livelihood from work, allowing people to live a life of meaning of their choosing. 

>Obviously, all this depends on the assumption that human beings don't have to be compelled to work, or at least, to do something that they feel is useful or beneficial to others. As we've seen, this is a reasonable assumption. Most people would prefer not to spend their days sitting around watching TV and the handful who really are inclined to be total parasites are not going to be a significant burden on society, since the total amount of work required to maintain people in comfort and security is not that formidable.(p.282)

We expect most people would want to be useful, do something of a work variety. But would they want to do the work that needs doing? Or would they all try to be poets, many of them bad poets? He concludes noting that 40% of the population is already doing something that is pointless, but it is not even interesting pointlessness. How could it possibly get worse?
