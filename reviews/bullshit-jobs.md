# Bullshit Jobs

A discourse on the phenomen of bullshit job: "a bullshit job is a form ofpaid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employmnent, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case."

## by David Graeber

Anarchist anthropologist at London School of Economics. 

## Rough outline

The book first details what is meant by a bullshit job, namely one that is useless. 

### Categorizing BS Jobs

1. Flunkies. They are largely around to make others feel more important by having others around. Often busy little tasks that don't seem to have much to do with a job description or being useful. Sometimes they sit somewhere just as a warm body.
2. Goons. Largely those without social value. An example might be someone who edits advertisements to make women look unrealistically thin in a way that makes real women feel bad about themselves. These are non-good PR types, corporate lawyers, telemarketers...
3. Duct Tapers. These are people doing something that only exists because the problem is not fixed, for some reason. Example is of a form submission setup that must be routed to a person because they decided to change the format but did not change a program. Or being a "proofreader" of someone whose reports are beyond awful. 
4. Box Tickers. They serve to simply ensure that some rule is being observed. Example: someone filling out a preference form that someone has to put in somewhere but the results are never consulted. Others might be highlighting pointless forms, helping people jump through government hoops, asking for funds, or be bureaucrats almost anywhere. 
5. Taskmasters. People who assign tasks to others even though those others could easily figure out what they need to do (Type 1) or people who create and oversee bullshit jobs (Type 2): "strategic" and other buzzwordy bullshit. 

### Why are people miserable in BS Jobs

This is a crucial question. Humans want to do something useful. They have their own intrinsic measurements as well as external. They want the validation that if they were to disappear, then someone would miss them. 

A great story is about someone who was the first to go to college from their family, very proud, got hired afterwards to deal with a content management system that was broken and that no one there wanted to work, and then tried to quit repeatedly. First the person learned a language. Then went on long drunk lunches, then long drunk weekends. Eventually, found someone else to take their job and quit while the boss was away on vacation. 

Humans generally have an MO of completing their work and then going off to do something else. A BS job does not allow that since there is no work to complete. It is not useful, but it is also never ending. One must also look busy, living a lie. 

Some of this are useful jobs that are basically being on call. There is not much to do every day, but there might be times when one is needed. In between, the vacuum of having nothing to do is dreadful. 

Doing anything useful, even if it is not for one's own benefit is far preferable for most people than to do something utterly and clearly pointless:  digging out rocks to build a draining trench is tough, but fine; digging a hole up just to put it all back and then repeat and repeat is completely dreadful. 

## What it is like to have a bs job

Looking busy is a necessity in many places. This leads to social media consumption, browsing the web when one can. One clever person used a terminal and text browser to browser the internet, giving the appearance of a lot of technical stuff.
