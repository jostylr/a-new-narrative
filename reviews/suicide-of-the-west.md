# Suicide of the West 

All in all, an interesting read for those not steeped in the lore of the reasonable parts of the right. However the charts in the back of the book are absolutely atrocious. For example, there is a graph that shows hours worked per worker that seems to suggest it goes to 0. Looking at the axes, it goes from 2200 hours in 1950 to maybe 1850 hours in 2015. But the 1850 is labeled as 0. Ugh. 

It definitely has the vibe of someone who has a conclusion and wants to find facts to support the conclusion. Nevertheless, this is useful so as to twist their narrative to our purposes.

A member of conservative think-tank American Enterprise Institute and involved in the National Review. Author of Liberal Fascism. 

Highly biased in favor of conservative ideas.

## Overview

The basic thesis of the book is that a Miracle happened in the 1700s in which the popular conception changed:

> This new thinking, whcih I call the Lockean Revolution, was a wide and deep change in popular attitudes. It held that the individual is sovereign; that our rights come from God, not government; that the fruits of our labors belong to us; and that no man should be less equal before the law because of his faith or class.

That is to say, the state was not just taking stuff from the producers and keeping it for themselves. He talks about the emergence of the idea of natural rights, limited government, and emergence of capitalism. Argues that these are unnatural. Wants to argue that the natural state is to view strangers as enemies and the institutions of us, particularly the free market, helps us to put the strangers in a context of non-violence. He presume violence is that natural way. 

I think my sense of reality is that the people in our circle we are inclined to freely help, and those outside of it are a question mark. Negotiation, ritual, violence, whatever, is all find for those. Scaling up from tribal to global is the question of our age. 

He makes an appropriately big deal about the importance of civil society in civilizing us to accept strangers. This is indeed a crucial point. And it is exactly here where the idea of universal dividend can most appeal to conservatives. Namely, they value civil society, it is a value which is not something that money can directly influence, but it is something which money can help support in the background. The existence of civil society is fundamental to the whole system working. So this is why we get a dividend. 

We want to belong and if there is not a larger group to join, then a smaller group will form in opposition. This is what is happening. 

>He is rejecting-- not without cause, of course--the Lockean worldview, the Miracle, in favor of the more natural and eternal politcal order. It works on the assumption that there is no extended order of abstract rules and contract, there is only power, loyalty, reciprocity, alliances, honor, and friendship. Right and wrong are defined by what is good for our tribe. 

Existence of wealth is based on the civil society instead of tribal alliances. 

## Human Nature

He tries to make the case that humans are brutal in their natural state. I disagree that we are fundamentally violent, but I fully agree that we are compatible with it and that some of us tend towards it much more readily than most of us. I also agree that the stranger can be subject to terrible violence without many moral issues. 

Argues about Rousseau's noble savage storyline which was very tempting to people. Then goes on at length about the YanomamÃ¶ culture. Blood feudsand women stealing. Goes on about torture and slavery as being very common in the past. Celebrates the deliberate ending of slavery. Dives into command economies and the slavery system there in political prisons. 

Delves into questions of how cooperation can be without sanctions. What will those sanctions be? 

Also states that the unnatural separation of various facets of our lives is a tension. 

## Corrupting the Miracle

Again emphasizes tribal brutality to others and argues that we should appreciate the modern prohibitions on such violence. 

>Rape is a tangible manifestiation of the corruption of civilized behavior. If you want to return to the time of the mythical noble savage, you want to return to a time when rape was a routine and acceptable practice in human affiars. (p. 50)

That is, the savagery should be attributed to something more primitive, a primitivity that civilization has slowly and gradually suppressed. 

Mentions how priests become a parallel aristocracy and wanted to leave property to descendants. This is where the rules about celibacy came from. Also mentions eunuchs in the Ottoman Empire, another attempt to prevent family from asserting. But that failed to. 

Relates a story about the corruption in business of friendship. If a stranger offers to pay a business owner to hire their son, it would be rejected. If a friend did the same, it would be much harder to say no. Along these lines is the notion of not opening a business in one's own neighborhood if they are many who depend on it. This is why harsh, inhumane bureaucratic rules get established and mercilessly enforced. 

## The State

Relates the formation of the state as evolving from roving bandits who took everything to those who settled and would leave enough for more to be made in exchange for protection against other roving bandits and themselves. There was incentive for both sides in mutual cooperation. Survival was more guaranteed. 

Abundance allowed for growth of the state beyond simple farming. Overabundance led to unnecessary hierarchy. 

Mentions how competition led to the growth of the states from these bandit stuff. 

Talks about acceptance of ideology of various castes.  It also talks about the desire and embrace of fatherly figures in societies, giving a certain sense of certainty, giving faith. 

## Birth of Capitalism

Goes into detail about the greatness of the English common system of law versus other places, a more egalitarian outlook, after a fashion. Talks about how the US Consitution was largely paving the cow paths of people's attitudes. It codifies something that was already somewhat understood. This is perhaps how to understand a lot of functioning of law. Change attitudes to change it. 

Mentions Venice as a place of communal governing until some got control and shut people out of it. 

How to keep it open to people? 

Captialism has creative destruction. Monopolies get swept away by new inventions. It undermines the powerful if the powerful are not using their resources effectively. This is in a free system in which money has not tilted government into protecting the wealth. 

But it also sees no value in extra-rational bits, like public spaces. It wants to run rough over them, replacing a park with a parking lot. Even democracy is subject to these impulses.

> The problem is that, as we've seen, the free market needs "extra-rational" customs and traditions to survive. The "capitalist order," Schumpeter explains, "not only rests on props made of extra-capitalist material but also derives its energy from extra-capitalist patterns of behavior which at the same time it is bound to destroy."  p.113

(Schumpeter, 1942 *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy*). 

Schumpeter also argues that there is market opportunity for a professional class to take aim at capitalism and its destructiveness, so as to profit from destroying capitalism itself. 

The success of capitalism then creates a whole class of intellectuals that disdain it. And so it falls apart. 

Capitalism therefore can fall apart from accumulations that prevent most people having resources or it can fall apart from a spreading of some resources to a class that will profit by attacking it. 

## Eternal Battle

Rousseau (wonder of tribal community) vs Locke (sovereignty of individual)

Locke's blank state was an attempt to undercut aristocratic hereditary bs. But it should also undercut the wealth accumulation. 

## American Miracle

Men created equally. Took a long time to unpack that... Christianity as the slave's religion of hope and equality to the masses, Declaration of Independence continuation of that. Ideals vs practice

Argued Founding Fathers setup a government to help check the natural inclinations to rip apart into tribes and seek advantage. Tryanny by majority is always a possibility. With checks and balances, they hoped to check that while using majority control to check the desires of the powerful to concentrate power. 

Difference between Locke and Rousseau. Locke, individual is prior to the state. Rousseau, the general will, is prior to the people. Freedom of speech, worship, etc., are outside domain of government regulation, defaulting to the individual's control. 

Claim:
> The Free market is the greatest anti-poverty program in all of human history. The legal system is important because it provides the guardrails for continuing human improvement. p.161

## The Elites

>As we've seen, the American Founders believed that the enemy of liberty was arbitrary power. p.165
