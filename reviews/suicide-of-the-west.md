# Suicide of the West 

All in all, an interesting read for those not steeped in the lore of the reasonable parts of the right. However the charts in the back of the book are absolutely atrocious. For example, there is a graph that shows hours worked per worker that seems to suggest it goes to 0. Looking at the axes, it goes from 2200 hours in 1950 to maybe 1850 hours in 2015. But the 1850 is labeled as 0. Ugh. 

It definitely has the vibe of someone who has a conclusion and wants to find facts to support the conclusion. Nevertheless, this is useful so as to twist their narrative to our purposes.

## Overview

The basic thesis of the book is that a Miracle happened in the 1700s in which the popular conception changed:

> This new thinking, whcih I call the Lockean Revolution, was a wide and deep change in popular attitudes. It held that the individual is sovereign; that our rights come from God, not government; that the fruits of our labors belong to us; and that no man should be less equal before the law because of his faith or class.

That is to say, the state was not just taking stuff from the producers and keeping it for themselves. He talks about the emergence of the idea of natural rights, limited government, and emergence of capitalism. Argues that these are unnatural. Wants to argue that the natural state is to view strangers as enemies and the institutions of us, particularly the free market, helps us to put the strangers in a context of non-violence. He presume violence is that natural way. 

I think my sense of reality is that the people in our circle we are inclined to freely help, and those outside of it are a question mark. Negotiation, ritual, violence, whatever, is all find for those. Scaling up from tribal to global is the question of our age. 

He makes an appropriately big deal about the importance of civil society in civilizing us to accept strangers. This is indeed a crucial point. And it is exactly here where the idea of universal dividend can most appeal to conservatives. Namely, they value civil society, it is a value which is not something that money can directly influence, but it is something which money can help support in the background. The existence of civil society is fundamental to the whole system working. So this is why we get a dividend. 

We want to belong and if there is not a larger group to join, then a smaller group will form in opposition. This is what is happening.
