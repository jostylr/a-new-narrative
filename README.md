# A New Narrative

This is a repository that will delve into a new narrative for our society, economy and politics. 

The basic principle is to find ways to maximize individual freedom, in balancing each other's freedoms and needs. Part of this is making choices about when an individual should have a certain freedom and when to curtail those freedoms. Speech, for example, should largely be free, but speech which intimidates and harass is not to be tolerated. Most agree with this in spirit, but where the line is precisely drawn is a matter of debate. 

While this is not meant to find out the specifics of that line, the general idea is to figure out the role of economics, government, and society in our life in support of this principle. They play back and forth with one another. 

This document is a table of contents, of sorts.
