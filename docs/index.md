# Universal Dividend

## A small price to pay for all of us to live lives of meaning

The Universal Dividend idea is that we are all helping to create, through our existence and many actions, the conditions necessary for society, economics, and government to exist and thrive. We invest ourselves into this great project that we are all undertaking together. As investors, we should all get a dividend for our efforts, just as investors in a company get a dividend from the company. And, often enough, that divdiend can be taken to reinvest and create new growth and more wonder into the world. 

The task before us is to understand this idea, see why it makes sense to pursue it, and, finally, figure out how to make it happen.
