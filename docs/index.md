# Universal Dividend

## A small price to pay for all of us to live lives of meaning

The Universal Dividend idea is that we are all helping to create, through our existence and many actions, the conditions necessary for society, economics, and government to exist and thrive. We invest ourselves into this great project that we are all undertaking together. As investors, we should all get a dividend for our efforts, just as investors in a company get a dividend from the company. And, often enough, that divdiend can be taken to reinvest and create new growth and more wonder into the world. 

The task before us is to understand this idea, see why it makes sense to pursue it, and, finally, figure out how to make it happen. 

## What is the Universal Dividend?

Every so often, say each week, a small amount of money, the dividend, is given to you and everyone else. This amount of money should, ideally, be enough to live on in a very minimal fashion, possibly with a few others. It should come out to at least above poverty level. 

For example, $13,000 a year, translating into $250 a week, would yield slightly higher than the poverty for one person. This is pretty minimal, but for a family offour, this would be $1000 a week and would provide a fairly livable standard. 

A key component of this is that everyone receives this same amount, regardless of wealth, age, condition, etc. The government may give more money to some, say a disabled person or an elderly person in order to help them further survive with dignity given that they may have more living costs and decreased opportunity for being economically productive, but that is a separate discussion. Here, we are focusing on the universal nature of this program, making this program something that does not lead to increased bureaucratic control. 

Nor is there any penalty to this amount for being wealthy or employed or anything else of that nature. 

There is, of course, a price to pay by someone in order to support this. How much? Well, for the US in 2018, we have 325 million people and at $13000 a year, we would need to generate 4 trillion dollars to pay this out. 

One proposal is a wealth tax. The wealth in this country is said to be 100 trillion dollars. At 4%, this would cover the cost. Conceptually, the idea of a wealth tax is that to retain an above average amount of wealth, one should be able to generate an above average return. 4% seems to be on a reasonable average growth and if one is just average, well, perhaps that wealth should be freed up to others. 

There are a variety of other schemes to [generate such monies](https://medium.com/economicsecproj/how-to-reform-welfare-and-taxes-to-provide-every-american-citizen-with-a-basic-income-bc67d3f4c2b8) and much debate could follow. I prefer a wealth tax because it helps offset the destructive force of capital accumulating in the hands of a few while still allowing for it to accumulate in the hands of the productive capitalists.
